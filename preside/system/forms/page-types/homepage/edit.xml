Sitetree page type: Homepage: edit form

This form is used when editing pages in the site tree manager whose page type is "homepage".
It gets mixed in with the [[form-sitetreepageeditform]] and its purpose is to remove a number of unwanted fields and tabs from the default form.

>>> There is no 'add' form for the homepage page type because there can only be and must always be a single homepage in a given site (subject to change).
