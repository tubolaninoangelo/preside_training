User: edit self form

This form is used for the "edit user" form in the user admin section of the administrator **when the user being edited is the same as the logged in user**.

>>> This form gets mixed in with [[form-usereditform]]. Its purpose is to remove the "active" flag control, preventing the user from deactivating themselves (the service layer also prevents this).
