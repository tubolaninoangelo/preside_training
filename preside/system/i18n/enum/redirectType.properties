301.label=301 Moved Permanently
301.description=A 301 redirect indicates that the resource has been *permanently* moved to the new locations. This is particularly important to use for moved content as it instructs search engines to index the new location, potentially without losing any SEO rankings. Browsers will aggressively cache these redirects to avoid wasted calls to a URL that it has been told is moved.

302.label=302 Found (Temporary redirect)
302.description=A 302 redirect indicates that the resource has been *temporarily* moved to the new location. Use this only when you know that you will/might reinstate the original source URL at some point in time.
