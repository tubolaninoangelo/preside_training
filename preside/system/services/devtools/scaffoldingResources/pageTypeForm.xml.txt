		This page type form has been scaffolded by the Preside dev tools scaffolder

		Forms for page types are "mixed in" to the core add and edit forms of the "page" object.
		This has the effect of giving you the ability to alter the add and edit forms of pages for
		this specific type.

		We have included bare tabs and fieldsets for the existing core form so that you can add fields
		to them without the need to look them up.

		You can also use this form definition to remove existing tabs, fieldsets and fields, e.g.

			<tab id="idOfExistingTab" deleted="true" />
			<fieldset id="idOfExistingFieldset" deleted="true" />
			<field name="nameOfExistingField" deleted="true" />

		Once you're done, do remove this comment :)
